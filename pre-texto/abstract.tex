  Currently, there is an expressive growth in the amount of visual content, such as images and videos available for use. The information contained in images and videos are used by the most areas of society, such as medical, industry and even for personal purposes.Every day new computational methods for recovering and analyzing images are studied. Two methods that usually been studied together are the localization and classification of objects. Architectures of Deep Learning can be implemented to localizate and classify objects, obtaining good results, however they have certain limitations such as the size of the objects or the resolution of the image. To avoid this limitation, it is intended to add convolution layers in the end of a Dense Convolutional Network to make the location of objects of different sizes more accurately. %After the final Convolution layers, Deconvolution layers will be added to increase the scale of the maps, and to decode the results of the convolutions in order to increase the accuracy of the result.
